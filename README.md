## This README.md is WIP
Make sure **ALL** your textures have *Texture Type* set to **Default**, *Compression* set to **None**, and *Generate Mip Maps* **unticked**. Some people have told me that for VRChat, compression and generating mip maps are recommended so that avatars are optimized. In that case, you may enable said options for most of the textures **except** the ramp textures so as to prevent artifacting and precision issues.

All ramp textures should have *Wrap Mode* changed from Repeat to **Clamp**. The specular ramp texture must have the *sRGB (Color Texture)* property **unticked**. 

All lightmaps, normal maps, and the face shadow texture should have their *sRGB (Color Texture)* property **unticked**. Keep in mind with what I've said earlier, the normal map should have the *Texture Type* set to **Default**. **IGNORE THE NORMAL MAP TEXTURE TYPE!**

## Rules
- The [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/festivize/Cheddar/blob/main/LICENSE) applies.
- If you use this shader as is in renders, animations or any form of medium that does not directly modify the shader, I'd appreciate being credited - **you don't have to do it though.**
- If you use this shader as the main reference for your own shader, please give credit where it's due.
- In compliance with the license, you are free to redistribute the files as long as you attach a link to the source repository.

## Disclaimer
This shader isn't meant to be 100% accurate - what I only aim for is to replicate the in-game looks to the best of my ability. Some calculations are exactly how the game does things, some are my own thrown into the mix.

While the shader is developed primarily for datamined assets, this repository does not endorse datamining in any way whatsoever and will never directly provide the assets nor tools in extracting from game files.

## Since you've read this far...
Using this shader is completely **free** if it's not already evident from the license BUT - if and only if you have something to spare and would like to support me, then you can do so on my Ko-fi [here](https://ko-fi.com/festivity). I appreciate every tip and each one motivates me to keep on improving the shader.
